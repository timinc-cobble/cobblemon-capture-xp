## What if…

…the Pokémon in your team could earn experience when you capture a Pokémon?

## Features

- Your team gains experience whenever you capture a Pokémon.
- You can modify the percentage experience received.
- Optionally, your team can gain EVs from captures as well.
- Works both in and out of battle, with individual options for both.

## Testing

Add Capture XP to your game, load into a world, and make sure you have at least one Pokémon on your team. Catch a Pokémon, whether in battle or out of battle. Once the capture is complete, you should see that your lead Pokémon gained experience as though they had battled the Pokémon you caught.
