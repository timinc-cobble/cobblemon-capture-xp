## Testing

Add Capture XP to your game, load into a world, and make sure you have at least one Pokémon on your team. Catch a Pokémon, whether in battle or out of battle. Once the capture is complete, you should see that your lead Pokémon gained experience as though they had battled the Pokémon you caught.
